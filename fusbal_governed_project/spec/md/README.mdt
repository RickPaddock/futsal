# ${project_name}

This repository is **governed by generation + guardrails**.

Hard rule:
- All human-readable `.md` files are **machine-generated** from `spec/` sources.

## What this project is

Fusbal is a **trust-first, offline (post-processed) futsal match analysis** system:
- Track players and the ball from venue (or user) video.
- Project movement into pitch meters (BEV) when calibration is good.
- Infer conservative V1 events (shots/goals) and produce a confidence-heavy report.
- Treat sensors as optional `TrackSource`s that can only improve results.

## Commands

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Generate all derived outputs: `npm run generate`
