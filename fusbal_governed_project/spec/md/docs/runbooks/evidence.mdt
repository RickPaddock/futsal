# Evidence

Evidence is captured as machine-readable JSON under `status/audit/<INTENT_ID>/runs/<run_id>/run.json`.

## Record a guardrails run

`node tools/evidence/record_run.mjs --intent-id INT-001 --out status/audit/INT-001/runs/<run_id>/run.json -- npm run guardrails`

## Record a generation drift check

`node tools/evidence/record_run.mjs --intent-id INT-001 --out status/audit/INT-001/runs/<run_id>/run.json -- npm run generate:check`

## Record a preflight review report

Preflight reviews should write a machine-readable JSON report that future humans/LLMs can reference.

Minimum expectations for the report content:

- Blockers are ranked by `roi_0_to_10` and include `effort` and `risk`.
- If a blocker can be resolved by relaxing scope or a requirement, include an explicit `override_option` marked as requiring human approval (never assume an override is accepted).
