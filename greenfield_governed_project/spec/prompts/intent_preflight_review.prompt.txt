LLM Audit Prompt: Intent Preflight Review (ambiguity + scope alignment + risk traps)

Perform an evidence-first preflight review of Project Intent <INTENT_ID> ("<INTENT_TITLE>").

This runs after Create Intent and before implementation starts.
Primary objective: eliminate ambiguity and scope mistakes before any code is changed.

Hard rule: this prompt is intent-artifacts-only.
- You MAY propose edits to canonical sources under spec/ (intents, tasks, requirements).
- You MUST NOT implement runtime/product code changes while running this preflight.

CONTEXT (provided by the caller; do not ask for these):
- `intent_id`: `<INTENT_ID>`
- `run_id`: `<run_id>`

SANITY CHECK:
- If `<INTENT_ID>` or `<run_id>` still contains angle-bracket placeholder markers, STOP: this prompt was not rendered with real values.

Repo governance constraints (must follow)
- Canonical sources: spec/project.json, spec/requirements/**, spec/intents/*.json, spec/tasks/*.json, spec/md/**/*.mdt
- Generated surfaces (never hand-edit): status/** and docs/**
- Reference docs: docs/runbooks/single-source-of-truth.md and docs/ops/governance/sources_and_flow.md

Inputs (read first)
1) spec/intents/<INTENT_ID>.json
2) status/intents/<INTENT_ID>/intent.md (read-only; generated)
3) status/intents/<INTENT_ID>/scope.json (read-only; generated)
4) status/intents/<INTENT_ID>/work_packages.json (read-only; generated)
5) For each planned task id in spec/intents/<INTENT_ID>.json, read spec/tasks/TASK_ID.json
6) Requirements sources: spec/project.json (requirements_source) plus the referenced spec/requirements/*.json

The 10 things this preflight MUST do
1) Confirm the intent is closeable in principle: identify what would be needed to close (tasks, quality audits, close gates, guardrail policy) and flag anything that requires guessing.
2) Ambiguity scan: quote vague phrases and rewrite them into measurable, testable statements.
3) Define terms + boundaries: list repo-specific terms used without definition and propose definitions/out-of-scope boundaries.
4) Acceptance criteria sanity: ensure acceptance criteria are objective; add missing negative paths/edge cases.
5) Task validity check: verify every planned task id in spec/intents/<INTENT_ID>.json exists as spec/tasks/TASK_ID.json and is spelled exactly.
6) Requirement validity check: verify every requirement id referenced is a real requirement id (no ranges) and consistent with the intent narrative.
7) Work package completeness: ensure generated work_packages cover all planned tasks (no unassigned tasks) and titles are clear.
8) Scope enforcement check: review paths_allowed vs paths_excluded for creep risk; ensure derived artefacts are excluded; ensure no workspace-specific path assumptions.
9) Guardrail policy plan: for each in-scope requirement, state the expected guardrail outcome (code reference vs tracked decision) and flag gaps.
10) Output a preflight report + unblock questions: provide a concise report and ask only the minimum clarifying questions needed.

Output requirements (in chat)
Return your result in this exact structure:

1) Preflight blockers (ranked by ROI): up to 10 items
	- For each: ROI (0–10), Effort (S|M|L), Risk (low|medium|high), Issue, Why it matters, Exact fix (wording/config change)
	- If a blocker can be addressed either by (a) tightening specs or (b) reducing scope/relaxing a requirement, include an explicit `Override option (optional)` describing the smallest acceptable override and its impact.
	- Overrides are recommendations only: never assume an override is approved unless explicitly confirmed by the human.

2) Ambiguities & rewrites (table)
	- Columns: Ambiguous text, Risk / likely mistake, Proposed rewrite

3) Scope alignment report
	- Inferred surfaces, paths_allowed, paths_excluded, Mismatches, Recommended edits

4) Closeability checklist
	- Tasks, Work packages, Close gates, Guardrail plan (PASS/FAIL with notes)

5) Suggested patch (optional but preferred)
	- If you can fix issues without asking questions, propose an apply_patch patch that edits only canonical sources:
	  - spec/intents/<INTENT_ID>.json
	  - spec/tasks/TASK_ID.json (only if needed)
	  - spec/requirements/** (only if needed)
	  - spec/project.json (only if needed)

6) Clarifying questions (only if truly blocking)
	- Ask 1–3 questions at a time.

HARD REQUIREMENT: write the report file first
1) BEFORE printing anything else to chat, you MUST write a machine-readable JSON report to:
   `status/audit/<INTENT_ID>/runs/<run_id>/preflight/preflight_report.json`
2) Then paste sections 1–4 into the chat window (do not paste the entire JSON file).
3) End your chat output with a final section:
  `Minimum next steps to achieve preflight pass`.
  - If the overall preflight result is PASS: this section MUST contain exactly one bullet: `None (preflight passed; no spec fixes required).`
  - If the overall preflight result is FAIL: provide 5–10 bullets, ordered and actionable, limited to the smallest set of canonical edits required to reach PASS.
4) After that section, your FINAL sentence in chat MUST be exactly:
   `ACTIVITY: preflight <INTENT_ID> <run_id>: finished - pass|fail`

Preflight report JSON schema (write to file)
{
  "type": "intent_preflight_report",
  "schema_version": 1,
  "intent_id": "<INTENT_ID>",
  "run_id": "<run_id>",
  "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
  "blockers_ranked": [
    {
      "roi_0_to_10": 0,
      "effort": "S|M|L",
      "risk": "low|medium|high",
      "issue": "...",
      "why": "...",
      "exact_fix": "...",
      "override_option": "optional"
    }
  ],
  "ambiguities": [ { "ambiguous_text": "...", "risk": "...", "proposed_rewrite": "..." } ],
  "scope_alignment": {
    "inferred_surfaces": ["..."],
    "paths_allowed": ["..."],
    "paths_excluded": ["..."],
    "mismatches": ["..."],
    "recommended_edits": ["..."]
  },
  "closeability": {
    "tasks": { "status": "PASS|FAIL", "notes": "..." },
    "work_packages": { "status": "PASS|FAIL", "notes": "..." },

    "guardrail_plan": { "status": "PASS|FAIL", "notes": "..." }
  },
  "minimum_next_steps": ["..."]
}

Start now by reading the inputs for intent <INTENT_ID>, writing the JSON report file, and then producing sections 1–4, then 6 if needed, followed by `Minimum next steps to achieve preflight pass` (see PASS vs FAIL rules above).

FINAL sentence requirement:
- Your FINAL sentence in chat MUST be exactly:
`ACTIVITY: preflight <INTENT_ID> <run_id>: finished - pass|fail`
