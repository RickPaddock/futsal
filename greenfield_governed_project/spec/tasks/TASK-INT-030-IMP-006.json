    "Improve auditability by emitting explicit TrackRecordV1 records for ambiguous detections rather than silently dropping them.",

    "When associations are ambiguous, output includes an explicit record with pos_state=unknown and diagnostics describing ambiguity.",
    "Ambiguity still causes breaks for tracks (break_reason=ambiguous_association) rather than swaps.",
    "Output remains deterministic (stable ordering)."
